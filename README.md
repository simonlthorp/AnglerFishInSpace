# AnglerFishInSpace
BC Game Jam 2019 Entry

Angler Fish in Space was made for BC Game Jam 2019 using the Unity Engine.  What I enjoyed most about this project was the opportunity to work with the great artist on our team.  I worked on the animation, the movement, and the mechanic for the dimming light.  I also worked with some of the less experienced members of our group to help them through using Unity, GitHub, and dealing with bugs.
